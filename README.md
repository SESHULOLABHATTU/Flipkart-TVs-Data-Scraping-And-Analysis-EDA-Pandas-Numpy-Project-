Flipkart TVs Data Scraping And Analysis – EDA Project

-- Project Overview

This project involves an end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on television product data collected from Flipkart using web scraping techniques. The primary objective is to analyze the TV market by examining pricing trends, brand distribution, product features, and customer preferences to derive meaningful business insights.

The project demonstrates practical skills in data extraction, data cleaning, visualization, and analytical thinking, making it suitable for Data Analyst and Software Engineer interviews, especially for freshers.

-- Objectives

- Collect real-world TV product data using web scraping

- Clean and preprocess raw, unstructured web data

- Perform detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA)

- Analyze TVs based on:

  - Brand

  - Screen size

  - Resolution

  - Price range

  - Ratings and reviews

- Identify market trends and customer behavior

- Present insights using effective visualizations

-- Problem Statement

E-commerce platforms like Flipkart offer a wide variety of TV models across different brands and price ranges. This creates challenges for understanding:

- Market dominance of brands

- Popular pricing segments

- Feature combinations preferred by customers

- Relationship between price, features, and ratings

This project aims to solve these challenges through data-driven analysis using web-scraped Flipkart TV data.

-- Tools & Technologies Used

- Programming Language: Python

- Web Scraping: Requests, BeautifulSoup

- Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy

- Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

- Environment: Jupyter Notebook

-- Dataset Description

The dataset is created by scraping TV product listings from Flipkart and contains the following attributes:

- Brand Name

- Model Name

- Price

- Screen Size

- Display Resolution

- Customer Ratings

- Number of Reviews

- Product Features (Smart TV, LED, etc.)
