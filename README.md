Flipkart TVs Data Scraping And Analysis – EDA Project
 Project Overview

This project involves an end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on television product data collected from Flipkart using web scraping techniques. The primary objective is to analyze the TV market by examining pricing trends, brand distribution, product features, and customer preferences to derive meaningful business insights.

The project demonstrates practical skills in data extraction, data cleaning, visualization, and analytical thinking, making it suitable for Data Analyst and Software Engineer interviews, especially for freshers.

🎯 Objectives

Clean and preprocess raw, unstructured web data

Perform detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Analyze TVs based on:

Brand

Screen size

Resolution

Price range

Ratings and reviews

Identify market trends and customer behavior

Present insights using effective visualizations

🧩 Problem Statement
