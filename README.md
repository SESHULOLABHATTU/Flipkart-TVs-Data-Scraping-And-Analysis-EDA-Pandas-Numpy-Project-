Flipkart TV Market Segmentation and Future Analysis
🔍 Project Overview

This project analyzes the Indian Smart TV market using product data scraped from Flipkart. The objective is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), identify market segments, extract pricing and feature patterns, and derive actionable insights that can support business decisions such as pricing strategy, product positioning, and demand forecasting.

This is an analysis-focused project, not a machine-learning-heavy one. The primary value lies in data cleaning, structuring, visualization, and interpretation of real-world e-commerce data.
